        Question-1 : Find a portfolio theme that you like and send the link to
        the professor. Make sure the theme allows for all the features on the
        project. What took you to choose this team? What is special about it?
        <hr />
      </h3>
      <p>
        <b>Answer : </b>I would like to use one portfolio theme from online.
        Here is the link :
        <a
          href="https://blackrockdigital.github.io/startbootstrap-creative/"
          target="_blank"
          >Portfolio</a
        >. I think this HTML theme is special because it is a bootstrap theme ,
        simple and I like it.
      </p>

      <h3>
        Question-2 : Make a list of all your work experience (start year, end
        year, company, position, responsibilities), most relevant education
        (start year, end year, school, degree), awards and certifications (year,
        title, cert number), list of interest, hobbies and languages you speak.
        <hr />
      </h3>
      <p>
        <b>Answer : </b>I have to change some sections for my project. Because
        this theme has no education, work experience, awards and certifications,
        list of interest, hobbies and language spoken section and I have to
        remove one section, "At Your Service" that I don't need. I am going to
        edit the theme according to the project requirement.
